# JSON Password Manager

### Description
    A little project I made as a kind of.. Beginner project as I've only started Python yesterday! So far I am enjoying the simplicity.
    Basically, it appends data you input directly to a `.json` file acting as a mock database almost.

    - Just run this through `python3` and follow the steps.
